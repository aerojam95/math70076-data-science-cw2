# A comparative study of machine and deep learning methods for image classification
This repository presents the second coursework for the MATH70076 Data Science module at Imperial College London, where the project showcases different machine and deep learning methods for image calssification

## Project description

## Data
 
- The dataset used for this comparative study was the MNIST-Fashion [MNIST-Fashion]https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset where it can be downloaded directly from the repository's [README page](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
- The [raw](data/raw/) folder contains all the raw downloaded data from the dataset's [README page](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), where it has been downloaded into this local directory for processing ready for use in the methods that will be used in this study


## Code

The code to produce the models and results for the comparative study can be found in [src](src/). Before using the code it is best to setup and start a Python virtual environment in order to avoid potential package clashes using the [requirements file](src/requirements.txt):

```
# Navigate into the project directory

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv <env-name>

# Activate virtual environment
source <env-name>/bin/activate

# Install dependencies for code
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# When finished with virtual environment
deactivate
```

## Outputs

### Model parameters

## Methods implement

### Gaussian Naive-Bayes

### k-Nearest neighbours

### Neural network

### Convolutional neural network

### Geometric neural network
