## Code

The code to produce the data visualisation charts is in [src](src/). Before using the code it is best to setup and start a Python virtual environment in order to avoid potential package clashes using the [requirements file](src/requirements.txt):

```
# Navigate into the project directory

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv <env-name>

# Activate virtual environment
source <env-name>/bin/activate

# Install dependencies for code
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# When finished with virtual environment
deactivate
```
